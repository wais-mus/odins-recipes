<h3>Directions</h3>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.</p>
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</p>
    <h5>Step 3 </h5>
    <p>Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat on medium-high. Saute onion and garlic for 3 minutes, or until onion is tender-crisp. Stir in broth and rosemary; bring to a boil. Stir in artichoke hearts and spinach; reduce heat, cover and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce.</p>
    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    <p>Spread 1/4 of the artichoke mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; top with 3 cooked noodles. Sprinkle 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese over noodles. Repeat layers 2 more times, ending with artichoke mixture and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle crumbled feta on top.</p>
    <h5>Step 5</h5>
    <p>Bake, covered, for 40 minutes. Uncover, and bake 15 minutes more, or until hot and bubbly. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.</p>
